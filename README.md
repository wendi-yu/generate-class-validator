# Generate Class Validator
Script that automatically populates a TypeORM entity with the `class-validator` validators we use to decorate. Meant to be used with entities generated by the `typeorm-model-generator` script available from npm.

### How to use
First clone the repo. You need some version of Python 3 installed, if it doesn't work try 3.8 because that's what I made it on :^). To set it up, run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It should be good to use now. The syntax is
```bash
py main.py path-to-input-file
```

and it prints the result on `stdout`. So to store the output in a file, you can run

```bash
py main.py path-to-input-file > path-to-desired-output-file
```

where the output file doesn't need to already exist. If it does, it'll be overwritten.
